<h1>Jenks' Favorite Films</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Favorite Films:</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Hands down my favorite of all time. No debate.
    The embodiment of live your dreams today, because tomorrow is never promised.</p>

<h3>The Polar Express</h3>
<p>Favorite Christmas movie.
    The artwork, Tom Hanks, the music, Tom Hanks, the feels... Tom Hanks (he's the man).</p>

<h3>Jeepers Creepers II</h3>
<p>Favorite horror movie, no doubt.
    Funny, creepy, internal teenage strife, but eventual mending of differences to survive? Top tier.
